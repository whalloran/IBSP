		Shaped by storm and tides, Island Beach State Park is a narrow barrier island stretching for 10 miles between the restless Atlantic Ocean and the historic Barnegat Bay. Island Beach is one of New Jersey's last significant remnants of a barrier island ecosystem that once existed along much of the coast and is also one of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches on the north Atlantic coast. Over 3,000 acres and 10 miles of coastal dunes remain almost untouched since Henry Hudson first described New Jersey's coast from the ship, the Half Moon, in 1609.
	</p>

	<p>
		Miles of sand dunes and white sandy beaches offer habitat to maritime plants and diverse wildlife that is almost the same as it was thousands of years ago. Island Beach contains outstanding examples of plant communities such as primary dunes, thicket, freshwater wetlands, maritime forest and tidal marshes. <span class="bold-p">The state's largest osprey colony calls our park home and they welcome a wide variety of visiting birds including peregrine falcons, wading birds, shorebirds, waterfowl and migrating songbirds.</span> Island Beach is nationally known as a unique resource with over 400 plants identified, including the largest expanses of beach weather in New Jersey.

<p>The Island Beach State Park Discovery Trails System provides a self-guided experience through the nine plant communities of a barrier island. Wayside exhibits located along each trail interpret the natural and cultural stories of the park. There are a total of 8 trails, each under one mile. For a copy of the Discovery Trails brochure and map, please contact the Park Office.</p>

<p>Horseback riding is permitted at Island Beach State Park from October 1 through April 30. There are six miles of ocean beach in the southern and central portions of the park available for equestrian use and a parking area is designated for horse trailers during this time period. Reservations are required by contacting the park office at (732) 793-0506.</p>

<div class="stripe-pale-green"><span class="stripe-txt">Recreation Area</span></div>

<p>Ten miles of pure white sand beach attract swimmers, sunbathers, anglers and surfers. Modern bathhouses, beach access ramps, a mile of beach with lifeguards, historic buildings, trails, interpretive programs, bike paths and facilities for people with disabilities combine to make Island Beach a unique place to explore. </p>

<div class="stripe-pale-green"><span class="stripe-txt">Barnegat Bay</span></div>

<p>The bayside of the island is a nutrient-rich feeding ground for birds, fish and other wildlife. Naturalist guided canoe and kayak tours during the summer months take participants through the Sedge Islands where they can observe a wide variety of wildlife, including nesting ospreys, falcons and wading birds. Bird observation blinds give visitors the opportunity to view the wildlife in this very important habitat.</p>

<div class="stripe-pale-green"><span class="stripe-txt">Island Beach Northern Natural Area (659 acres) and Southern Natural Area (1,237 acres)</span></div>

<p>Together, these two natural areas encompass one of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches in the northeast United States. Rolling sand dunes, salt-sculptured vegetation, lush green salt marshes, and nine plant communities including a nationally significant maritime forest characterize Island Beach. The federally threatened piping plover is an occasional inhabitant of the open beaches and dunes. Access to portions of the Northern Natural Area is restricted.</p>

<div class="stripe-bright-grn"><span class="stripe-txt">Special Use Permit Application</span></div>

<p><span class="bold-p" style="padding-right: 0;">Please note:</span> Special use permits are subject to review and approval by the park.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/docs/special_use_permit_application_package_complete.pdf">Special Use Permit Application Package</a></p>

<p>A Special Use Permit is utilized to accommodate a specific activity or event being conducted over a short duration. There are two types of special use permits: Non-Commercial and Commercial and fees are based on NJ residency and Non-residents.  A completed application must be submitted to the park/forest area where the activity or event is being held at least 90 days prior to the event. If the special use or event is extremely large or complex, at least one-year’s prior notice is recommended. </p>

<div class="stripe-pale-green"><span class="stripe-txt">Pets</span></div>
<p>
	From Memorial Day Weekend through the first of October, pets are not permitted on the Ocean Swimming Beaches (lifeguarded areas). Pets are permitted South of the Ocean Swimming Areas during this time period but must be held on a leash (maximum length - 6 feet) and you must clean up after your pet. Pets are not permitted on the Spizzle Creek Bird Blind Trail at any time.
</p>


<div class="stripe-pale-green" id="fish"><span class="stripe-txt" id="activities">Fishing</span></div>

<p>Island Beach State Park is well known by New Jersey's saltwater anglers for excellent surf fishing for striped bass and bluefish. Other species include summer flounder and weakfish. During the appropriate season, fishing for tautog along the north jetty of Barnegat Inlet is especially rewarding. Bait and fishing information may be obtained at local tackle dealers before entering the park. Saltwater fishing is subject to <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/fgw/saltwater.htm">New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife</a> and State Park Service regulations. Information regarding saltwater fishing regulations can be found in the Fish and Wildlife Digest, which is available at local tackle dealers.</p>

<p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, Mobile Sportfishing Vehicle permits to operate 4-wheel drive vehicles on the fishing beaches may only be obtained through the mail.  <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/Island%20Beach%20Permit.pdf">Download an Annual Mobile Sportfishing Permit application</a></p>

	The Emily DeCamp Herbarium is a collection of approximately 400 plants that have been classified and preserved, giving the public an opportunity to learn about the nine plant communities at Island Beach State Park. One of the main attractions of this herbarium is that the visiting public and scientists are able to handle and examine individual plants. Plants have been placed in a protective mount that also gives historical and factual information about the plant. The herbarium is kept at the Forked River Interpretive Center.
